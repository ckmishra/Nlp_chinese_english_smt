Data
----

In the data directory, you are provided with counts collected from
training data which contained reference segmentations of Chinese
sentenes.

The format of the `count_1w.txt` and `count_2w.txt` is a tab separated key followed by a count:

    __key__\t__count__

`__key__` can be a single word as in `count_1w` or two words separated by a space as in `count_2w.txt`

For bigrams the probability of the first word in a sentence w can be looked up in `count_2w.txt` as

    <S> w	Count
