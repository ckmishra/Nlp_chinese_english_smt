mazda3 i-stop : sustained a sporting spirit
mazda will prove that the spirit of sport is not angry with the respect of the environment .
to this end , it has to incorporate on the mazda3 and arrest the system to start the engine , called i-stop , an arrangement that , at least for the moment , there is the 2.0 gasoline engine of 150 horses .
this second generation of mazda3 is illustrated by the note that it has achieved in its entirety .
the details , the revision of the vehicle , the habitabilité , behaviour , the mechanics , the i-stop system ...
all of these are outstanding on the new mazda3 .
starting with the post of conduct , it is true that the seats fronts have a ergonomie and excellent setting .
the reach of the steering wheel is also very pleasant .
by continuing with the whole formed by both the picture of control and the equipment , we see how mazda continued along the tendency to create an internal futuristic design , with many japanese buttons and orders , as well as the vivid colors red and blue .
this style is a reminder , in part , that the honda civic .
therefore we can say that the mazda3 as well as the civic , both japanese , contrast with the reticence of german products , especially with the volkswagen golf , which all want to overcome .
in keeping with the compact , the japanese car shop presents a habitabilité more than sufficient to allow to four adults to travel with a high level of comfort .
comes on top of all that a great trunk to regular forms .
and arrest the system of automatic start to the engine , at least for the moment , is available only on the gasoline engine , of two litres and 150 horses and change manuel six speeds .
this engine is a true happiness , it can be illustrated by the delicacy , its low noise , its benefits and the control of its consumption .
indeed , even the most requested that the mazda3 are diesel models , those who do not carry out a large number of miles per year should not exclude this i-stop speed with gasoline engine , both for his great comfort that controlled for consumption .
concerning the equipment , the chosen for the test model is the sport , in other words that has the largest number of elements of " series .
among the change of road - series , the assistant equipment rvm that removes one death , the speed of traction and stability control , the regulator , the internal photosensible mirror , the computer on board on a large screen size , the independent sensors parking , air conditioning , the capteur of rain and light , the bluetooth and audio , as well as the wheels of the bluetooth alignment of 17 inches , are particularly impressive .
in addition , as if this equipment is not enough , the premium had version of the pack , which for 1,500 euros , include elements of adaptive headlights bi-xénon and a disc audio system bose with charger .
more
the mazda3 2.0 i-stop are one of the best car compactes of its class .
it shows in particular on the quality of the materials used , by his behaviour and through its high standard equipment .
in addition , those who do not carry out a lot of kilometers per year will be able to choose the i-stop involved only the gasoline engine version 2.0 of 150 horses .
its high price is the only drawback of this model , which is between 21 770 euros on the finishing luxury and 23 270 euros for the sporting tested , the model .
in return for the large sum , the mazda3 every day we will provide a high degree of satisfaction .

the pledge of fonpeek
peek is extremely limited , it is a system that allows only to watch his electronic mail , without giving the possibility if only to see some type of coins attached or surf the internet .
it profita of its five minutes to glory in the united states , if the magazine the désigna as one of the products of the year .
in truth , it is not difficult to see him in the street , but the idea seems interesting , especially for the young people .
contrary to the smart phones , peek offers a very low price and a monthly subscription , which is less than half of the costs , for example , the subscription data of the iphone .
in view of its success , the company has launched two new devices , one designed exclusively for twitter , one with a free service life of data , for six times more expensive than the peek .
fonpeek , presented yesterday in the event the web is the european version of the invention , and its third incarnation .
it is so limited that the american grand-frère , but has come as a surprise .
the price for its monthly subscription , nearly 12 euros , includes the roaming across europe .
those who travel with a smartphone already know what is the abandonment to the data when you cross the border or seek desperately a cafeteria on the wifi - or a connection to fon - to be able to check his mail .
the idea of a roaming a fixed price is incredibly seductive , and for a long time that it should work .
indeed , some companies have special arrangements and options journey , but as far as i am concerned , i would need to be made a thesis in physics for the understanding and good glasses to read the fine print .
repeated calls for the order of the european commission to propose affordable price of roaming in the whole of europe has had a barely perceptible effect .
outside of their country of origin , are reluctant to use the data , and it is not wrong .
only a small plane as fonpeek - it is always curious he is called fon so that it does not possess the wifi - offer this kind of tariffs , means that operators are starting to think differently and study various proposals to increase their data network .
kindle is another example , they understand the downloading of books and other research on the internet .
without a subscription and without together .
it is connected with a device and it pays in his purchases and not every month .
and that is what i hope one day to see the fonpeek : an option to purchase with access to life as peek proposes already in the united states .
not as i want to buy it .
i look at my letters on my phone , thank you .
i would simply because i believe that this is a fair formula for the consumer .
it would be interesting to have a computer with the same system .
a favourite colour of michelle
the favourite yellow is , without any doubt , the colour of the united states ' first lady .
if it went to the assumption of office of barack obama to the presidency of the united states with a habit ' and a coat of this color , it has , in fact , chose the same to accompany him in the second time , without any doubt , the most important of his life in oslo : the award of the nobel peace prize .
michelle obama was a very similar model on both occasions : besides colour yellow ressemblante , a shooting towards the green with bright , both times , the views held consists of three parts : the habit ' , jacket and , at the same , tissue and coats ornée of great broderie or a string .
so that a first glance , it seems that the first lady of the united states should follow the example of the princess of asturias and chose to put the same place .
but the fabric in which they are carved up the two groups makes them very different .
if the assumption of office , he was a dentelle thick , on the other hand , it was printed in oslo a velvet .
the accessories , too , are different : green shoe to heel means for the first time , and a similar pattern golden , but this time .
hairdressing it has changed : the hair are now faced while she was down the last time .
75 % of professional working mothers have had problems as a result of their babies
discrimination at work has increased over the past few years , especially for the women of the young people who want to be mothers .
reveals that the study " fertility and women 's professional career in spain , " carried out by the csic together with the instituto de mujer .
the survey , conducted on 9 737 women from 15 to 75 years , leaves no room for doubt : 75 percent of working mothers have seen their professional career limited because of the babies .
the study indicates that there are many differences regarding the beginning of life in a partnership , and the number of children , whether or not the woman works and occupied the kind of job .
those who do not have to work outside the home , work part time or have a stable job shortly , reached earlier in a partnership , and have more children have their first pregnancy earlier .
however , women who have a stable job , mostly in the public sector , to postpone the entry in life in a partnership and the first pregnancy , and have fewer children .
women aged between 35 and 49 to have a fixed work have their first child , on average , 3.7 years after having built in a couple . that figure rises to 4.1 among those who work in the public sector . " these data show that women have a stable job requiring more time in their lives for that , which led them to postpone the union and the arrival of the children .
more broadly , the type of job exercised influence the maternity leave , but less common starting date of life , " explains the chercheuse csic 's margarita delgado .
the level of education is another factor that widening the gap of the age of the marriage of women and their first child .
according to the survey , the higher the level of training is high , the more they are marient have their first child late .
the difference remains as among the women of the same generation .
for example , in the group that between 35 and 49 years , those who have made elementary and higher studies have been mothers respectively for the first time to 25,1 and to 32,1 years on average .
" another disctinction is also among the women , according to the level of education .
while those who carry out the basic studies have marient and have their first child had to find a stable job , those studies of higher average level or reverse the programme and give priority to the achievement of a stable work as a condition for marriage and the arrival of a child , " says mrs delgado .

a cowardly act of aggression
last week , my mother , who has about 70 years ago , promenait fuenlabrada in our district of the city , when a group of young people aged between 15 and 18 years spent in addition to it and our dog , a sang-mélé , rescued in the spa and weighing no more than six kilos , and without saying a word , they assenèrent feet who grew the dog seriously wounded two birds .
outrage is huge because we do not see what it is amusing to attack defenceless free of charge a small animal , in addition , was on a leash .
this is in addition to the outrage of a woman who is promenait quietly and , when it came injuria these individuals to fear for physical integrity as a énergumène attacking an animal is capable of doing the same thing to a woman , a child , a ' and , ultimately , anyone who is lower than him .
the episode held at around 5 a.m. , a tuesday as one , in an area normally calm .
pavlov 's dog has gémi throughout the day .
of course , we have submitted a complaint to the police station of the area even if we doubt that it used to much , and not to touch the sensitivities , we just want to clarify that the cowardly murderers were spanish .
outrage has led us to denounce this fact .
we do not understand what is happening to the young people so that they are fun to mistreat free an animal without defence which gives us the love , friendship and keeps us company .
we do n't know where is the good education , and the respect for animals and the people .
michelin and fesvial , sets to the port of the helmet
the tyre manufacturer michelin , in collaboration with the spanish foundation for road safety , fesvial , has launched a campaign to encourage the wearing of the helmet , mainly among motorcyclists more young people , as said today the two bodies .
this initiative aims to promote awareness of the importance of the wearing of the helmet , since it is the only part of protection to avoid head injuries , or even death , in case of an accident in two wheels .
michelin said that the campaign was in keeping with his commitment to road safety , which goes beyond the design and manufacture of products increasingly safe " , and said that it is contributing to this goal by other actions to educational and informative .
this new campaign to encourage the port of the helmet on two wheels , under the motto " to be but not to be , " a first stage in which include posters will be distributed in more than 500 garages effect , in order to guarantee the widest spread .
finally , michelin has pointed out that the road safety is a constant concern " for the company , because as a tyre manufacturer for vehicles on two wheels , one of its main objectives is to develop products increasingly safe .
the sale of light commercial vehicles to go
after nearly two years ago , the light commercial vehicle market is beginning to see a little bit of light at the end of the tunnel .
the 9 425 vehicles registered in november in spain is an increase of 12.6 % compared to 2008 and , what is more important , they represent the first increase after 22 consecutive month of decline , according to the figures of the patronal manufacturers association anfac and ganvam , the dealers .
however , we need to alter the good news , because the reference for the comparison , the month of november 2008 , has been particularly bad , with a reduction of 60 % compared to the previous year .
as a result , despite the events of the last month , the immatriculations accumulated during the 11 months are 40 % in less than those of the previous year .
since january , if you add all vehicles coming into the category of light commercial vehicles - derived from cars , light pick-up , vans , fourgons and light trucks to windows 95 853 have been sold .
high clouds that affect their request did not eliminated . in fact , although they are bought by individuals , most of the purchases are made by small and medium sized enterprises , which pay in nearly 100 % of the cases thanks to an external financing .
and , in addition to the restrictions involved by restricting credit , we need to add other factors such as the rise in the unemployment rate and the continuation of the bad economic situation .
faced with this situation , and in contrast to the cars , the aid to the purchase of the 2000e were used .
as well as individuals , independent and those who wish to acquire a commercial vehicle slightly less than 3.5 tonnes with a level of carbon dioxide emissions , which does not exceed 160 grams per kilometre , can also benefit from it , but the number of operations speaks for itself .
yesterday , in ganvam , it recalled once again the need for the government to pay special attention to these vehicles and also the industrial vehicles , trucks and buses .
the dealers ' association provides a year 2010 similar to that ends , for which she found a fall in sales - passenger vehicles and the suv of 19 % .
the emergency brake is now required aid
as has occurred with the system anti-lock restrictions abs and it will take place with the esp , stability control systems of aid in the emergency brake compulsory will form part of the european cars .
mandatory they are already on the newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles , while for the rest of the vehicles , a period has been set up to the end of february 2011 .
the measure , imposed by the european union , is intended to strengthen the protection of pedestrians , even if , because of its course of action , it can also help to avoid many blows back .
the assistant to the emergency brake is increasing pressure on the brakes in urgent cases detected in the system through the shot in the foot of the driver .
but they do not always keeps the pressure until the end of time .
according to a study conducted by the manufacturer of parts for cars bosch , one third of the drivers involved in an accident did not rely on the brakes before the collision , and half of them did not benefit from its full force .
up to 1 , 100 accidents
intervention of aid , in revancha , requires the maximum of the braking system , cutting the distance which needed to stop the car .
according to a study by the eu , if all the cars are equipped with this type of points , up to 1 100 fatal accidents in which pedestrians are involved could be prevented each year .
this reduction would be even more important with the ' popularisation of smart emergency braking systems : it is a sinister about four with the injured would be avoided .
in this case , the vehicle is equipped with a system that , thanks to a radar or a camera , detect obstacles and to prevent the driver , in addition to slightly on the brakes .
if the driver is applied , it help in increasing the pressure on the , if it is necessary .
if it does not act , and that the crash is inevitable , it has a maximum effort on the brakes in order to minimize the damage .
general motors postponed until january to the opel plan to
while the workers of the opel plant in figueruelas - zaragoza - have been warned by nick reilly , the new chairman of general motors , gm europe , that the production of the new meriva would be launched in the first week of april - probably the 8 - according to javier ortega , the north american manufacturer has warned that it will need more time to conclude the opel rescue plan .
nick reilly , the new president of gm europe , to each of the plan has been approved in advance by the parties concerned .
and this may mean that the final document , which will first be submitted to workers and then to the governments of the countries where there are factories , be postponed until early 2010 .
among gm , by contrast , there is a guarantee that a decision on the sale of saab should be made within the next few days .
it is therefore not surprising that the swedish government has tightened the pressure on the american manufacturer in order to take a decision as soon as possible .
gm says come into contact with a possible new buyers .
one of them could also be geely , which aspires to acquire volvo , but the application of the dutch sports car manufacturer skyper , supported by the russian converg group , is increasing in importance .
in cases where there would be an agreement with any of them , gm could sell a part of saab to the chinese company baic .
the decision to close down saab at the end of the year if it is not sold is upheld .
behind the wheel of a porsche boxster spyder
to develop their final porsche and valuable gem , engineers went to the boxster s and have succeeded in the amincir that nothing less than 80 kilograms , leaving the balance to a mere 1 275 kilos .
this led to happen in the first place , the automatic roof which has been replaced by a roof bâché manuel , to reduce 21 kilograms , using doors in aluminium like those of the gt3 , other 15 kilos of less , to remove the climatiseur , 13 kilos , and to reduce the 64 to 54 litres of petrol tank , 7 kilograms of earned , to engage in bacquets sport , yet 12 kilos , and light with tyres 19 inches , five kilos .
finally , they gave up on audio system cdr-30 , earning a further six kilograms and replaced the poignéesdes doors by handfuls of tissue , saving the remaining kilo .
although the model also exists with the pdk box with a double embrayage manual , the test was carried out on a model to box of secondary six speeds , mostly on the roads of the network of california , especially in mountains , with however tortuous .
his behaviour can only be described as beyond reproach .
reducing weight does not mean the car to drive in the soil , with aplomb .
on the contrary , it was a long time since we had not tested a model as small and light , which , at the same time , guarantee security , particularly in the however , including at high speed .
it is a small , capable of " athlete échauffer its musclesà small speed for as long as necessary , until we ask him to sprinter , once again to curb , to recover and to push its engine ...
it is out what we wanted . thanks to his leadership , as forthcoming as accurate , the car will do this show our hands on the steering wheel .
and they will do so with surgical precision .
its force to will
the sound of his constantly boxing v6 , with 320 horses - 10 more than the boxster - was very successful and it can be strengthened with the option " sport " or through a system that is changing the rugissement of the engine , already used on the panamera .
the ability of acceleration is brutal , whether in the ruling or in success .
the suspensions are firm , but not hard and uncomfortable .
the surface of the roads that we have travelled with the boyxster spyder was blighted enough , but the car has managed the nests of chicken .
electronic assistants were barely in an appearance on the whole journey , while in some however we have found the ice in the early morning and graviers , later in the morning .
ultimately , a car ultralégère , one of the most divertissantes to lead , and which is much more than a simple change to the boxster s.
the car will be put up for sale in february last year , at a cost of 70 831 pounds .

vitoria 's team has been able to fill the important absence from herrmann , oleson huertas or micov by a large dose of collective commitment and work , even if it had to wait until the end to victory .
in addition , the great skill from the perimeter , with 16 baskets to three points scored , détermina far beyond the final victory .
the match started quickly for the blue and red , who had the advantage from the start .
the fact that the first four baskets of vitoria 's team should be conducted from the perimeter , was a sign that they have jumped on the ground with the israeli poignets hot .
english , and teletovic have been the main sponsors of the first quart-temps final 18-20 .
the second quart-temps was in the same tone , but the team of internal barac alava has chosen the game and the work of eliyahu , which has been received by the cheers and applause of returning to his former home , to increase their advantage in the break - 34-43 .
teletovic already started to draw attention to themselves as the best player of his team , with 13 points scored , while the least six ' assessment of splitter was already predict that night was never going to be the best in the brazilian .
but in this game , despite the fact that they are on the right track to the break , nothing was done , far from it , and the team of avala wanted to remind by vitoria , that it is not so easily on their land , and thanks to the hand of elias , they succeeded in entering the match .

brazil sets a date for the beginning of zelaya
the brazilian government has set a timetable for the manuel zelaya 's stay in his embassy in tegucigalpa .
the deposed president will have to abandon the légation diplomatic on 27 january 2010 at the latest , the date of the official end of his term of office .
francisco catunda , in charge of affairs of the brazilian embassy in the capital of honduras , has confirmed in tv globo that " mel " knows that he must leave the embassy , where it is refugee since september 21 , before that date .
" he is aware that it must be based on 27 january , at the end of his mandate , it should seek another destination . "
the channel has also cited the former agent , who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the end of the deadline stated : " my position is logical to leave as soon as possible , with the support of the brazilian government , " zelaya said by telephone .
after the elections of the 29 november , during which porfirio lobo was elected , zelaya has assured that it would remain in the brazilian embassy until january .
, however , the same week , he has tried to seek asylum in brazil .

thanks very much
after days rose since early last year , during which asset inflation was the dominant note on the markets , the uncertainty arises again , which is not surprising because it is a matter of their natural state , in an area where the agents to take decisions on an uncertain future in nature .
the remedy used by central banks to stabilise the markets has been to monetize the debt by the direct purchase of assets and , indirectly , by providing abundant liquidity at rates close to zero , so that the purchase of assets to mobilize financial institutions .
central banks have already confirmed that the direct purchase of assets have almost been finalised , and , without prejudice to their political maverick of liquidity , are starting to put a little bit of sand in the machinery , such as the ecb , with their award for one year to the next week .
as a result , investors have doubts about the ability of the global economy to maintain an economic revival without heterodox measures and we are witnessing a inversely to reduce the risk premium .
volatility grants and different corporate bonds rise again , although they remain very distant paranormaux levels that they have achieved at the beginning of the year .
states are being forced to socialising the risk of private and public debt is threatened once again .
there is once again a flight to quality and the united states , japan and germany were the shelters chosen by investors , provocative more of the differences between the countries in the euro zone and germany .
spain has been barely affected by this episode of instability , but then standard & poor 's threatened with a new downward revision to the qualification of the kingdom of spain .
on the other hand , a little bit of uncertainty is not a bad to silence the defenders of moral risk , tried again to create a case of awareness among lesresponsables of global economic policy which had impeded the destructive effects resulting from the credit limit on the destruction of the jobs , although what we should do is declare a new day of action for pardons .
dubai , however , the situation seems to be a fight between tribal sheiks to restore its place in power in the emirates , and we have already seen the case of greece .
a government which hides a public deficit of the elections , and a new government that finds the pot with roses .
prodi did in italy after silvio berlusconi and socrates in portugal after durão barroso and
it is quite irrational ecofin saves hungary to a lack of respect for its external payments at the beginning of the year and allow a member state of the euro area does not respect its commitments .
what makes sense , however , is that the ecofin incited the greek government transparency , and makes its citizens are partly responsible for the need of extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances .
if , as expected , we are faced with a transitional round of normalization of risk premium , after some excesses in positions , this would be expected .
in the case of spain , as long as our differences in the public debt has risen to match the obligations of european companies , nousn' have not to worry us .
if our differences and that europeans were continued to rise , and then it would be a risk idiosyncrasique spanish .
the standard & poor 's case is a story . when our forecast indicators force most studies services to anticipate their models of recovery and to revise upward their forecasts for 2011 , together with the oecd and the european commission , which lies on the offensive with a japanese pourl spanish economy model , it adds little hope for their warning .
once again , this has all seem to be an excellent opportunity to buy assets in spain , although for the moment " caution is the mother safety . "
sectors that are connected

iberdola , however , believes that for the next decade , the investment should not be used to increase the production capacity , but the distribution networks and to international connections .
by 2020 , the issue , and it will increase the power change .
his bet focuses on both gas and coal plants , with mechanisms for the recovery of the carbon dioxide and , above all , on renewable energy sources .
in this field , he believes that 18 , 000 megawatts of more are needed , along with other sources of support . "
galán sustainable economy , which believes that the draft law that the government has to approve is in line with the calls for his company , did not want to tackle the royal decree aimed at encouraging the use of coal , which contradicts the national policies to combat global warming .
according to him , there is a clear challenge to the long term in this direction , " despite the " specific measures , " as the president of iberdrola has qualified .
however , galán believe that investment decisions , although they are in the long term , will start to be taken , as they put some time before they reach their maturity and a lucrative stable framework is needed to address them .
