mazda3 i-stop : a sustainable sporting spirit
mazda intends to prove the sporting spirit is not angry with respect for the environment .
to this end , it has to incorporate the mazda3 the system of ruling and launch of the driver , called i-stop , a measure which , at least for now , is available on the gasoline engine 2.0 150 horses .
this second generation mazda3 shows by the note that it did in its entirety .
the details , the revision of the vehicle , the habitabilité , behaviour and mechanism , the system i-stop ...
all these things are outstanding on the new mazda3 .
starting with the driving position , it appears that the seats fronts have ergonomie and excellent setting .
the affect of the steering wheel is also nice .
by continuing with the whole formed by both the picture of control and equipment , we see how mazda continued in japan 's trend to create an internal futuristic design , with many buttons and orders , as well as vivid colors red and blue .
this style reminds us , in part , the honda civic .
therefore we can say that both the mazda3 and civic , both japan contrast with moderation of german products , particularly with the volkswagen golf , which all want to overcome .
in tangled with japan 's shop , the vehicle is habitabilité more than enough to allow four adults to travel with a high level of comfort .
in addition to all of this great trunk to regular forms .
engine arrest and start automatic system , at least for the moment , it is available only on the gasoline engine , two litres of fuel and 150 horses and with change manual of six speeds .
this engine is a true happiness . it is by its delicacy , low noise , benefits and the control of its consumption .
indeed , although the most requested mazda3 are diesel models , those who do not carry out a number of kilometres per year should not exclude this i-stop with gasoline engine , both for his great comfort to speed and controlled consumption .
on the level of equipment , the model chosen for the test is the sport , in other words that has the largest number of elements series .
series of equipment , an assistant of change of road - rvm that removes one dead , the speed of traction and stability control , the regulator , the interior photosensible mirror , a computer on board on a large screen size , the independent parking sensors , air conditioning , the capteur of rain and light , the bluetooth and audio , as well as the wheels of the bluetooth alignment of 17 inches , are particularly noteworthy .
in addition , as if this equipment is not enough , the premium was version of the pack , which include elements to 1,500 euros more of adaptive headlights bi-xénon disc audio system and bose with charger .
conclusion
the mazda3 2.0 i-stop is one of the best compactes cars in its category .
it shows in particular by the quality of the materials used by his behaviour and its high standard equipment .
moreover , those who do not carry out many kilometres per year will be able to choose the i-stop linked only to the gasoline engine version 2.0 of 150 horses .
its high price is the only drawback of this model , which is between 21 770 euros for the finish luxury and 23 270 euros for the model tested , the sport .
for this large sum , the mazda3 every day we will provide a high degree of satisfaction .
" first ' luxury
l.a. is the red carpet to sensualité embodied by penélope cruz , nicole kidman and fergie .

the promise of a fonpeek
peek is extremely limited , it is a system which allows only to watch his electronic mail , without the opportunity to see even some type of coins attached or surf the internet .
he profita about five minutes of glory in the united states , when the magazine désigna as one of the products of the year .
in truth , it is more difficult to see in the streets , but the idea seems interesting , particularly for young people .
unlike the smart phones , peek provides a very low price and a monthly subscription , which is less than half of the costs , for example , the subscription data of iphone .
given his success , the company has launched two new devices : one designed exclusively for twitter , one with a free service data for life , for six times more than the peek .
fonpeek presented yesterday , in the event the web , is the european version of the invention and his third incarnation .
it is so limited that the american grand-frère , but with a surprise .
the price of its monthly subscription , about 12 euros , includes roaming across europe .
those who travel with a smartphone already know what represents the abandonment to the data when you cross the border or seek desperately a cafeteria on the wifi - or a link between fon to consult his mail .
the idea of roaming at a fixed price is incredibly seductive and for a long time that it should work .
indeed , some companies have special arrangements and travel options , but as far as i am concerned , i would need to have a thesis in physics for the understanding and good glasses to read the fine print .
repeated a call to order from the european commission to provide affordable roaming fees in the whole of europe have had a barely perceptible effect .
outside its country of origin , it is reluctant to use the data , and it was not wrong .
as a small plane as fonpeek - he is always interested he is called fon when he does not possess the wifi - offer this kind of tariffs , means that operators are starting to think differently and study various proposals to increase their network of data .
kindle is another good example , he understands the downloading of books and further research on the internet .
without charges and together .
it is connected with a device and it pays during his purchase and not every month .
and that is what i hope one day to the fonpeek : an option to purchase with access to life as peek proposes that is already in the united states .
not because i want to buy it .
i look at my mail on my phone , thank you .
i want more just simply because i believe it is a formula for the consumer .
it would be interesting to see how a computer with the same system .
the favourite colour of michelle
yellow is the favourite , without a doubt , the colour of the first lady of the united states .
if it went to the assumption of office of barack obama to the presidency of the united states with a habit ' and a coat of this color , indeed , she chose the same to accompany him in the second time , without a doubt , the most important of his life : in oslo the award of the nobel peace prize .
michelle obama was a very similar model both times : besides colour ressemblante , a yellow shooting towards the green with a bright , both times , the views held consisted of three parts : the habit ' , jacket and , at the same , tissue and coats ornée of great broderie or a string .
so that a first look , it seems that the first lady of the united states following the aftermath of princess of asturias and chose to put the same place .
but the base in which are carved up the two blocs make them very different .
if the assumption of office , it was a thick dentelle in oslo , on the other hand , it was a velvet printed .
the accessories are different : green shoe to heel means for the first golden opportunity , and a similar model , but this time .
hairdressing too has changed : the hair are now taken when it was abandoned the last time .
75 % of the professionals working mothers had problems because of their mothers
discrimination at work has increased over the past few years , particularly for women of younger generations that want to be mothers .
shows that the study " fertility and women 's professional career in spain , " carried out by the csic together with the instituto de mujer .
the survey , conducted on 9 737 women from 15 to 75 years , that leaves no room for doubt : 75 % of working mothers have seen their professional career limited because of the babies .
the study indicates that there are many differences regarding the early life couple , and the number of children , whether or not the woman works and occupied the kind of job .
those who do not work outside the home , work part time work or have little stable , reached earlier in a partnership , and have more children have their first pregnancy earlier .
however , women who have a stable job , mostly in the public sector , reject the entry into the living couple , and the first pregnancy , and having fewer children .
women between 35 and 49 years with a fixed work have their first child , on average , 3.7 years after having built in couple . that figure rises to 4.1 in those who work in the public sector . " these data show that women have a stable job was needed more time in their lives for that , which led them to reject the union and the arrival of the children .
more broadly , the kind of employment exercised influence the maternity leave , but less common date of life , " explains the chercheuse the csic margarita delgado .
the education level is another factor which is widening the gap in the age of marriage of women and their first child .
according to the survey , the higher the level of training , the more they are marient and have their first child later .
the difference is also maintains among women of the same generation .
for example , in the group with between 35 and 49 years , those who have made higher basic studies and mothers were respectively for the first time in 25,1 and 32,1 years on average .
" another disctinction is also among the women , according to their level of education .
while those who have done basic studies marient and have their first child had to find a stable job , those studies of average level or above reverse this program and give priority to obtain a stable work as a condition for marriage and the arrival of a child , " says mrs delgado .

a cowardly aggression
last week , my mother , which has about 70 years , promenait fuenlabrada in our district of the city , when a group of young people aged between 15 and 18 years spent in addition to it and our dog , a spa and sang-mélé , saved weighing no more than six kilos , and without saying a word , they assenèrent feet who grew the dog seriously injured two birds .
outrage is huge because we do not see what is funny free to attack a small animals without defence which , in addition , was on a leash .
this is in addition to the outrage of a woman who is promenait quietly and , when it came injuria these individuals to fear for physical integrity as a énergumène attacking an animal is capable of doing the same thing to a woman , a child , a ' or , in the final analysis , anyone lower than him .
the episode came at around 5 p.m. , just like any other tuesday , in an area normally quiet .
the dog was gémi throughout the day .
of course , we have submitted a complaint to the police station of the area even if we doubt that it used to much , and not to touch the sensitivities , we just want to clarify that the cowardly murderers were spanish .
outrage has led us to denounce it .
we do not understand what is happening to young people to find amusing to mistreat free an animal without defence which gives us the love , friendship and keeps us company .
we do not know where is the good education and respect for animals and people .
michelin and fesvial sets for the port of headphones
the tyre manufacturer michelin , in collaboration with the spanish foundation for road safety , fesvial , has launched a campaign to encourage the use of helmet , mainly among motorcyclists youngsters like said today the two structures .
this initiative aims to promote awareness of the importance of the port of headphones , since it is the only element protection to avoid head injuries , or even death , in case of an accident in two wheels .
michelin said that the campaign was in keeping with his commitment to road safety , which goes beyond the design and manufacture of products always safer and said " it is contributing to this goal by other actions to educational and informative .
this new campaign to encourage the port of the helmet with two wheels , under the motto " to be but not to be " , a first phase during which include posters will be distributed in more than 500 garages effect , in order to guarantee the widest spread .
finally , michelin has stressed that the safety ' is a constant concern for the company as tyre manufacturer vehicles on two wheels , one of its main objectives is to develop products more safe .
sales of light commercial vehicles advance
after nearly two years ago , the market for light commercial vehicles beginning to see some light at the end of the tunnel .
the 9 425 vehicles registered in november in spain is an increase of 12.6 percent in 2008 and , more importantly , they represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of decline , according to figures by the patronal manufacturers association anfac and ganvam , the dealers .
however , we need to balance the good news , as a reference for the comparison , the november 2008 , has been particularly bad , with a reduction of 60 % compared with the previous year .
as a result , despite last month 's events , the immatriculations accumulated during the 11 months are 40 percent less than those of the previous year .
since january , if we add all vehicles entering the category of light commercial vehicles - derived from cars , vans , pick-up fourgons light and light trucks with windows 95 853 have been sold .
high clouds that affect their request did not disappear . in fact , although they are bought by individuals , most of the purchases are made by small and medium enterprises , who pay in almost 100 % of the cases thanks to an external funding .
as more restrictions involved by limiting the credit , we must say other factors such as the rise in the unemployment rate and the continuation of the bad economic situation .
faced with this situation and difference for passenger cars , support for the purchase of the 2000e were used .
as well as individuals , independent and those who wish to acquire a light commercial vehicle up to 3.5 tons with a level of co2 emissions that does not exceed 160 grams per kilometer , can also benefit from it , but the number of operations speaks for itself .
yesterday , among ganvam recalled once again the need for the administration to pay special attention to these vehicles and industrial vehicles , trucks and buses .
the dealers ' association provides a 2010 similar to that ended , for which she is a fall in sales , from cars and the suv , of 19 % .
emergency aid to stop is now required
as has occurred with the system anti-lock restrictions abs and it will take place with stability control systems , esp , compulsory emergency aid to brake will form part of the european cars .
mandatory they are already on the newly licensed passenger cars and light commercial vehicles , while the rest of the vehicles , a period has been set up at the end of february 2011 .
the measure , imposed by the european union , is intended to strengthen the protection of pedestrians , even if in its course of action , it can also help prevent many blows back .
an assistant to the emergency brake is increasing pressure on the brakes in urgent cases detected by the system through shot in the foot of the driver .
but it has not always the pressure until the end .
according to a study by the manufacturer of car components bosch , one third of the drivers involved in accidents did not support the brakes before the collision , and half of them did not profit from its full force .
up to 1 100 accidents
the intervention of the assistance , revancha , requires maximum braking system , reducing the distance the car needs to stop .
according to a study by the eu , if all cars were with this type of points , up to 1 100 pedestrian accidents in which are involved could be prevented each year .
this reduction would be even more important with a popularisation emergency braking as intelligent systems : it is a sinister on four with the injured would be avoided .
in this case , the vehicle is equipped with a system that with a radar or a camera , detect obstacles and prevents the driver , slightly in addition to act on the brakes .
if the driver is , it applied by increasing the pressure on the assistance , if needed .
if it does not act , and that the collision is inevitable , it is the maximum effort on the brakes so as to minimize the damage .
general motors postponed until january the plan for opel
when workers of the opel plant in figueruelas zaragoza , were warned by nick reilly , the new president of general motors , gm europe , that the production of the new meriva would be launched in the first week of april , probably on 8 , according to javier ortega , the american manufacturer has warned that it will need more time to conclude the opel rescue plan .
nick reilly , the new president of gm europe , is that each of the plan has been approved in advance by the parties involved .
and this may mean that the final document will first be submitted to workers and the governments of the countries where plants , be postponed until early 2010 .
however , among gm , means that a decision on the sale of saab should be taken in the next few days .
so it is no surprise that the swedish government has stepped up pressure on the american manufacturer to take a decision as soon as possible .
gm admits being in touch with possible new buyers .
one of them could also be geely , which seeks to acquire dutch volvo , but the application of the manufacturer of sports cars skyper , supported by the russian converg group , is increasing in importance .
in cases where there is agreement with any of them , gm baic chinese could sell part of saab of the company .
the decision to close saab at the end of the year if it is not sold is maintained .
behind the wheel of the porsche boxster spyder
to develop their final porsche and valuable gem , engineers went to the boxster s and have succeeded in the amincir nothing less than 80 kilos , leaving the balance only 1 275 kilos .
this led to happen in the first place , the automatic roof which has been replaced by a roof bâché manuel , to reduce 21 kilograms , using doors in aluminium like those of the gt3 , other 15 kg less , to remove the climatiseur , 13 kilograms , to reduce the 64 to 54 litres of petrol tank , 7 kilograms of earned , to engage in bacquets sport , yet 12 kilos , and with tyres light of 19 inches , five kilos .
finally , they gave up the audio system cdr-30 , earning six kilograms and replaced the poignéesdes doors by handfuls of tissues , saving the remaining kilo .
although the model also exists with the pdk box with a double embrayage manual , the test was carried out on a pretty box of secondary six speeds , mainly on the roads of the network of california , in the mountains , with particularly tortuous however .
its behaviour can only be described as pure .
reducing weight does not prevent the car to drive on the ground with aplomb .
on the contrary , it has been that we did not have tested a model as small and light which , at the same time , guarantee security , particularly in the however , including at high speed .
it is a small athlete , capable of échauffer its musclesà small speed for as long as necessary , until we asked him to sprinter , to curb , to recover and to push the engine ...
out , this is what we wanted . through his leadership as forthcoming as precise , the car will show our hands on the steering wheel .
and she will do so with surgical precision .
its engine will
the sound of his constantly boxing v6 , with 320 horse - 10 more than the boxster - was very successful and it can be strengthened with option " sport " or through a system that is changing the rugissement the engine , already used on the panamera .
the ability of acceleration is brutal , at the ruling or hopping .
the suspensions are uncomfortable farms but not hard .
road roads that we have travelled with the boyxster spyder was blighted enough , but the car has managed the nests of chicken .
electronic assistants were barely here across the board , while on some however we have found the ice in the early morning and graviers later in the morning .
in short , a car ultralégère , most divertissantes drive and is much more than a simple change to the boxster s.
the car will be put on sale in february last year , at a cost of 70 831 pounds .

ivanovic , injured players , but far from dead , needed to follow some actions were to take the air , and then tell the mitraillette mirza teletovic who , with three consecutive baskets to three points and the help of english and ribas remit to a reassuring score - 54-67 - meter , and that the local success to increase at the end of the third quart-temps - 57-67 .

the unicaja lost loudly in greece at the olympiacos and gave him the lead in group b of the euroligue , in a match marked by the absence of players in the internal unicaja , especially in the game - freeland , lima and greek archibald , that have facilitated the victory .

thank you very much
after days rose since last spring , when asset inflation was the dominant note on the markets , the uncertainty arises again , this is not surprising because it is a matter of their natural state , in an area where the agents to take decisions on an uncertain future by nature .
the remedy used by the central bank to stabilise the markets has been to monetize debt by the direct purchase of assets and indirectly , by providing abundant liquidity rates close to zero , so that the purchase of assets to mobilize financial institutions .
central banks have already confirmed that the direct purchase of assets have almost been finalised , and , without prejudice to their political maverick of liquidity , are starting to put a bit of sand in the machinery , such as the ecb , with contracts to a year of next week .
as a result , investors have doubts about the capacity of the global economy to maintain an economic recovery without heterodox measures and we are witnessing a inversely to reduce the risk premium .
scholarships and different business obligations are increasing volatility again , although they remain very distant paranormaux levels they have achieved at the beginning of the year .
states have been forced socialising private and public debt in the risk is threatened once again .
there is again a flight to quality and the united states , japan and germany were the shelters chosen by investors , provocative more of the differences between the countries in the euro area and germany .
spain was hardly affected by this episode of instability , but then standard & poor his threatened with a new downward revision of the evaluation of the kingdom of spain .
on the other hand , some uncertainty is not a bad to silence the defenders of moral risk , trying again to create a case of awareness among lesresponsables of global economic policy which had hampered the destructive effects resulting from the credit limit on the destruction of employment , and what we should do is declare a new action day pardons .
however , the situation in dubai is a fight between tribal sheiks to restore its place in power in the emirates , and we have already seen the case of greece .
a government that conceals a public deficit , elections and a new government , which finds the pot with roses .
prodi did in italy after berlusconi and socrates , portugal durão barroso .
it is quite irrational ecofin hungary saved a breach of its external payments at the beginning of the year and to allow a member country of the euro area does not respect its commitments .
what makes sense , however , is that the ecofin incited the greek government to transparency and make its people share the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances .
if , as we hope , we are facing a round of normalization of transitional risk premiums , after some excesses in positions would be predictable .
in the case of spain , until our differences in the public debt has risen to match the obligations of european companies , nousn' have not worry us .
if our differences and that the europeans were continued to increase , then it would be a risk idiosyncrasique of spain .
the standard & poor 's case is a story . when our forecast indicators most studies services must anticipate their models of recovery and revise upward their forecasts for 2011 , together with the osce and the european commission , which are on the offensive with a japanese model pourl spanish economy , it adds little hope for their warning .
again , it is the air to provide an excellent opportunity to buy assets in spain , even though at the moment " caution is mother safety . "

iberdrola , ignacio sanchez galán chairman , was the first to speak yesterday before the subcommittee of the congress of deputies , which is discussed these days of spain 's energy strategy in the coming two decades .
after his speech , which was followed by the president of gas natural-fenosa , rafael villaseca , mr galán outlined to the press that he had said before the subcommittee , huit-clos .
for president of iberdrola , spain needs to invest 50 million by 2020 and 60 000 million more between now and 2030 , today , in the event of nuclear power plants in operation would remain open .
if that is not the case , the necessary investments but will not estimated at 60 billion to 95 million .
iberdola , however , consider that over the next decade , investment must not be used to increase the production capacity , but the distribution networks and to international connections .
by 2020 , the question is changing , and it will increase the power .
his bet focuses on both gas and coal plants , with the recovery of the carbon dioxide and mechanisms , especially on renewable energy .
in this area , we consider that 18 thousand megawatts of more are needed , along with other sources of support . "
galán sustainable economy , which believes that the draft law that the government has to approve along the lines of what calls for his company , did not want to tackle the royal decree to encourage domestic consumption of coal , which contradicts the fight against global warming policies .
according to him , there is a clear challenge to the long term in this sense , despite the measures " isolated , " as the president has called for iberdrola .
however , galán believes that investment decisions , although they are in the long term , will start to be taken because they put some time before they reach their maturity and a lucrative stable framework is needed to address them .

naturally , to use a computer and connected to the internet are necessary .
once the model to repair identified thanks to the number of windows , a graphic image model in question is can you really necessary selects the room .
the user can include variables such as the price of the workforce , supplements or reduced , then he can give the estimate to get to the customer .
audataller is not a tool to estimate as audaplus , but a series of references .
