the neckline , very important for enhancing the silhoutte , is one of the facts we should take into account .

endesa and barcelona with the electric car
the electric company endesa , together with barcelona city council , has created ' office live . '
this is a project to develop and promote the electric car in the catalan capital .
office live ' -lrb- logistics for the implementation of the electric vehicle -rrb- will define and coordinate the roadmap for the implementation of the electric car in the city , and will define the conditions for mobility , management , coordination , present subsidies , etc .
moreover , movele will develop the project , promote the electric car , review public opinion and work from the sectors involved .
in short , it hopes to promote what will be the transportation of the future .
3 ' electric cities '
but barcelona is not the only city that is going to be involved in the implementation of the electric car in spain .
madrid and seville are joining the project .
they are the three cities chosen by the government to promote the implementation of the electric vehicle within the movele plan .
the electric company endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the generalitat of catalonia .
with that , it hopes to promote the activities of the research and technological development in the autonomous community of catalonia .
these include activities linked to energy and , in particular , energy efficiency .
it is not the only initiative endesa is involved in regarding the promotion of the electric vehicle .
the company participates in standardization groups at the european level and has a series of active complementary projects , such as g4v , elvire and cenit verde .
zapatero sees ' a horizon of peace ' for the automotive sector .
the prime minister , jose luis rodriguez zapatero , catches a glimpse of ' a horizon of peace ' for the spanish automotive industry , which , he pointed out , is the principal export sector in the country .
in the prime minister 's presentation of the economic report for 2009 , zapatero reviewed the measures the government had launched throughout the fiscal year to support the automotive sector .
" without the automotive competitiveness plan , today we would have a panorama of neglect and the closure of some of our major production plants , " the prime minister explained .
" through this plan and the arrangement of the brands to continue in this highly competitive sector in spain , we can have a horizon of peace for the future of this industry , which is our principal export sector , " he added .
in this regard , he recalled that thecompetitiveness plan , included in the comprehensive plan of the automobile industry -lrb- pia -rrb- , allocated 800 million to projects of 19 manufacturers and 137 auxiliary companies , which mobilized an investment of more than 3 billion euros .
the head of the executive branch explained that this investment was committed as much to the development of new models as it was to upgrading already existing products and processes .
zapatero also stressed the government 's measures to support the demand , alluding to plan 2000e , implemented in collaboration with the autonomous communities and automotive brand .
according to the prime minister , this plan has reduced emissions by 6 % in new vehicles sold on the spanish market and has brought about a " sharp increase " in enrollment , which rose by " 40 percent " in november ..

mazda3 i-stop : sustainable sportsmanship
mazda wants to show that sportsmanship is not incompatible with the environment .
therefore , mazda3 has just added an engine stopping and starting system - dubbed as the i-stop - , a mechanism which is , for the moment at least , only available with the 150-horse power 2.0 petrol engine .
this second generation of the mazda3 stands out for its overall high ratings .
the finishes , features , comfort , performance , mechanics , the i-stop system ...
all of these aspects are outstanding in the new mazda3 .
starting with the driver 's seat , we see that the front seats offer excellent ergonomics and support .
the feel of the steering wheel is also exquisite .
moving on to thecombination of the dashboard and console , we see how mazda has continued the japanese tendency to create a futuristic interior design with a great deal of buttons , knobs and striking red and blue colors .
this style reminds us , in part , of the honda civic .
so , we can say that the mazda3 and the civic , both japanese , contrast with the sobriety of the german products , more specifically , the volkswagen golf , which everyone wants to beat .
continuing with the interior , this japanese compact is easily roomy enough for four adults to travel in great comfort .
all of this comes with a spacious trunk and standard dimensions .
the engine 's automatic stopping and starting system , at least for now , is only available with the two-liter , 150-horse-power , manual , six-gear , petrol engine .
this engine is a real delight.what makes it outstanding are its subtlety , reduced noise levels , features and fuel consumption .
and even though the diesel versions of the madzda3 will be in higher demand , those who do n't do too much mileage a year should not dismiss this i-stop petrol engine system , both for its elevated driving comfort and its fuel consumption .
as regards the level of the equipment , the version chosen for the test is called the sportive , meaningit incorporates a high number of standard elements .
the standard equipment is excellent , especially the lane changing assistant -lrb- rvm -rrb- which eliminates the blind spot , the traction and stability controls , the speed control , the interior photosensitive mirror , the large-screen onboard computer , the parking sensors , independent climate control , rain and lights sensor , bluetooth and bluetooth audio , and 17 " alloy wheels .
additionally , with less equipment , this version comes with the premium pack , which , for 1,500 euros , also features : bi-xenon adaptive headlights and a bose sound system with cd changer , among other things .
conclusion
the mazda3 2.0 i-stop is one of the best compacts in its category .
it is particularly outstanding in terms of the quality of the materials used , its performance , and the high standard of its equipment .
additionally , those who do less yearly mileage can opt for this version of the i-stop , associated only with the 150-horse-power 2.0 engine .
the only drawback of this model is its high price , which ranges from 21,770 euros for the luxury pack to 23,270 euros for the sportive version , tested here .
in exchange for the high price , the mazda3 will offer a large daily dose of satisfaction .
deluxe ' premiere '
l. a. covers the red carpet of sensuality by the hand of penelope cruz , nicole kidman and fergie .
the stars were more dazzling than ever , wrapped in designer dresses , as elegant as they were sexy , at the premiere of ' nine ' . -lrb- photos : gtresonline -rrb-
our own ' pe ' , as sophisticated as ever , decided on a dark ' lady . '
the promise of fonpeek
peek is extremely limited , a device that 's only used for checking email , without no feature for viewing certain kinds of attachments or surfing the web .
it enjoyed its 5 minutes of fame in the u.s. when times magazine named it one of the products of the year .
seeing it on the street is more difficult , to be honest , but the idea can be interesting , especially for children .
unlike smartphones , the peek is very cheap and has a very low monthly fee , less than half , for example , of the iphone 's data plan .
given its success , the company has released two new devices : one exclusively for twitter , the other with a free data service for life in exchange for paying six times more for the peek .
fonpeek , presented at the la web event yesterday , is the european version of the invention and its third incarnation .
it is just as limited as its u.s. counterpart , but comes with a surprise .
the monthly service price , around 12 euros a month , includes roaming throughout europe .
those who travel with a smartphone already know what it 's like to have to give up data when they cross the border or desperately search for a cafe with wifi -lrb- or a fon connection -rrb- to check their mail .
the idea of fixed-price roaming is incredibly attractive and long awaited .
yes , some operators have special arrangements and travel plans , but in my experience it takes a doctorate in physics to understand them and good glasses to read the fine print .
the repeated twisting of the european commission 's arm to get affordable roaming rates across europe has had almost no noticeable effect .
there 's a fear of using data outside one 's home country , and rightly so .
for a gadget like the fonpeek -lrb- it no longer seems strange that it is called fon since it lacks wifi -rrb- to get this kind of fee , it means that the operators are starting the think differently and study different means of recouping the cost of their data networks .
the kindle is another good example , including a book downloading feature and other internet queries .
no contracts , no bother .
it 's a connected device and is paid for when it 's purchased , not month by month .
and that is what i hope to see one day with fonpeek , a call option with life-time access , which the peek already has in the u.s.
not because i 'm going to buy it .
i check my mail on my phone , thank you .
i hope so because i think it 's an unfair model for the consumer .
it would be interesting to see a computer with the same system .
michelle 's color fetish
yellow is , without a doubt , the u.s. first lady 's favorite color .
she already attended barak obama 's inauguration as u.s. president in a yellow dress and coat ; she chose the same to accompany him to what was undoubtedly the second most important moment of his life : the nobel peace prize ceremony in oslo .
michelle obama wore a very similar dress on both occasions : apart from being a similar yellow-green color with bright highlights- , both times the outfit consisted of three pieces , a dress , jacket and coat of the same material , and was adorned with a large embroidery or necklace .
so much so that , at first glance , it seemed the first lady of the u.s. has been following the princess of asturias ' lead and has opted to repeat her wardrobe .
but the material the two suits are made of make them very different .
if the inauguration was about thick lace , in oslo it was patterned velvet .
the accessories have also varied : green medium-heeled shoes the other time , and now a similar design , but in gold .
and equally different is the hair style : on this occasion , hair tied back ; previously she wore her hair down .
75 % of working mothers have had work problems during maternity .
discrimination at work has increased in recent years , especially for women of younger generations who want to be mothers .
this has been revealed by a study entitled ' fertility and work history of women in spain ' , developed by the csic in collaboration with the women 's institute .
the survey of 9,737 women from 15 to 75 years old leaves no doubt about it : 75 % of working mothers have seen their opportunities in the workplace limited due to maternity .
the study notes that there are many differences in when couples start cohabiting , in the number of children , depending on whether they work or not and the type of work they do .
those that do n't have an activity outside of the home , work part time , or do n't have a stable job start living with their partner sooner , expect their first child , and have more children .
by contrast , women with a stable job , especially in the public sector , put off cohabitation and motherhood and have fewer offspring .
" women between 35 and 49 years old with steady work have the first child , on average , 3.7 years after starting to live together , a figure which increases to 4.1 ; women with steady jobs need more time to achieve their lifelong goals , which has led them to postpone getting married and having children .
additionally , the type of job held has a great influence over maternity , but less over the mating schedule , " explains csic researcher , margarita delgado .
level of education is another factor whichdifferentiates the age of women marrying and having their first child .
according to the survey , the higher the level of education , the older the age at which they get married and have their first child .
there was also a difference among women from the same generation .
for example , in a group of 35- to 49-year-olds , those who had elementary and those who and higher education had become mothers for the first time , on average , at 25.1 and 32.1 respectively .
their level of education provides yet another division among women .
while those who have an elementary education marry and have their first child before finding a stable job , those who have secondary or higher levels of education reverse the sequence and give priority to securing a stable job as a precondition to marriage and having a child , " delgado specifies .
diane kruger is also worth it
l 'oréal paris has just added a new name to its enviable list of ambassadors : diane kruger .
starting next year , the german actress will become the image of the brand 's different products , singing the universal slogan ' because i 'm worth it . '
the star of ' joyeux noël ' , one of the finest actresses on the international scene , joins other celebrities signed to l 'oreal paris , like linda evangelista , jane fonda , andie macdowell , eva longoria and the spaniard penelope cruz .
before her , the last ones to enter such an elite club were the actresses evangeline lilly -lrb- ' lost ' -rrb- and freida pinto -lrb- ' slumdog millionaire ' -rrb- .
for the men 's line , the cosmetic brand also includes deluxe ambassadors : patrick dempsey -lrb- ' grey 's anatomy ' -rrb- and matthew fox -lrb- evangeline 's co-star on ' lost ' -rrb- .

poker by manuel vicent
in ' four aces ' -lrb- alfaguara , illustrations by fernando vicente -rrb- manuel vicent gives us thirty profiles of writers who have passed through their literary life -lrb- and , in some cases , the other one too -rrb- .
he does not do it in predictable or terrible ways -lrb- biographical sketch , life and work -rrb- , rather by looking for something that sparked the creation of the character .
the trip has its excitements , and vincent us spares no scares or illuminations .
in addition to being an exquisite pleasure , the book is a touching invitation to be read and reread .
here are some snippets .
on albert camus : " in his pages i discovered that the mediterranean was n't a sea , rather a spiritual instinct , almost physical , the same one i felt without giving it a name : the pleasure against the ill-fated , morality without guilt , and innocence without any god . "
on samuel beckett : " nihilistic , allegorical christian , he wrote what was in his blood , not in his intellect , between impotence and ignorance , with a dazzling poetic humor , meaningless , like the blade of the knife that was about to kill him . "
on graham greene : " our man was abducted by this woman with a passion that lasted for thirteen years , in which flesh combined the excitement of adultery with the pleasure of remorse , a spiritual privilege which consisted of reaching heaven through the road of perdition . "
on james joyce : " ' ulysses ' was published in paris in 1922 by sylvia beach.this is one of the eight-thousand-meter peaks of world literature which must be scaled by the north face , which the best mountain climbers hurl themselves off time and time again . "
on william faulkner : " he was a weird guy . "
of himself , he sometimes said that he was the heir to a landowner in the county , and other times that he was the son of a black woman and a crocodile .
" they were both dreams of grandeur . "
on louis-ferdinand celine : " this writer took the deranged scream cried from a bridge by that character from munich in order to carry his eco , under his literary form , into the depths of the night of the 20th century , and made it a journey , hiding from himself and calling on the past with a violent discourse to the worms . "
on dorothy parker : " one day , she kneeled and prayed : ' dear god , i beg you to make me stop writing like a woman ' . "
on joseph conrad : " on his tomb were engraved these verses from spencer : ' sleep after toil , / port after stormy seas , / ease after war , / death after life does greatly please . " '
on virginia wolf : " she also carried her depressions in her luggage .
the husband accepted it as normal when she told him that edward vii spied on her from the azaleas and that the birds sang in greek .
there has never been a man so patient and in love with a neurotic woman whose literary talent came before her madness . "
on pio baroja : " what did martin-santos do but try to inoculate joyce in baroja ?
what did benet try but to pass baroja through the weapons of faulkner ?
what did cela do but abduct the glory of that man so that it would serve his own pedestal ?
cowardly aggression
last week , my 70-year-old mother was walking through our neighborhood in the town of fuenlabrada when a group of kids between 15 and 18 years old passed alongside her and our dog , a mixed-breed , rescued from the pound and weighing no more than six kilos , and , without saying a word , kicked the dog twice , leaving the dog badly injured .
our indignation knew no bounds because we do n't see the fun in gratuitous aggression towards a small and defenseless animal , which by the way , was on a leash .
it must be added that it distressed the woman who was calmly taking a walk and who , when she reprimanded those individuals , came to fear for her safety , because a lunatic who attacks an animal is capable of doing the same to a woman , a child , an elderly person , and , certainly , to anyone weaker than himself .
the incident took place on atuesday at five o 'clock in the afternoon in what is usually a quiet neighborhood .
the dog was crying all day .
by the way , we filed a complaint at a nearby police station which we doubt means much , notto stir up trouble , just to clarify that the cowardly murderers were spanish .
the outrage has led us to denounce this fact .
we do n't understand what is happening when young people consider it fun to gratuitously mistreat a defenseless animal which gives us love , companionship and friendship .
we do n't know if there is any politeness and respect for animals and people left .
michelin and fesvial united on the use of helmets
the tire manufacturer michelin , in collaboration with the spanish foundation for road safety -lrb- fesvial -rrb- , has launched a campaign to promote the use of helmets , especially among younger motorists , both organizations reported today .
this initiative aims to raise awareness of the importance of wearing a helmet , because it is the only means of protection capable of preventing head injuries and even death in the event of an accident while riding a motorcycle .
michelin indicated that this campaign is part of their commitment to road safety which " goes beyond designing and manufacturing safer products every day , " and added that it also contributes towards this goal by means of other educational and informative measures .
this new campaign promoting helmet use in motorcycles , under the motto ' to be or not to be , ' will initially distribute posters to more than 500 motorcycle shops to spread the message as widely as possible .
finally , michelin stressed that road safety " is a constant concern " for the company , as being a manufacturer of tires for two-wheeled vehicles , one of its main goals is to develop ever safer products .
sales of light commercial vehicles on the increase
almost two years later , the light commercial vehicle market begins to see the light at the end of the tunnel .
the 9,425 vehicles registered in november in spain represent a rise of 12.6 % from 2008 , and , more importantly , indicates the first increase after 22 consecutive months of decline , according to figures from the manufacturers association -lrb- anfac -rrb- and the vendors association -lrb- ganvam -rrb- .
however , it 's not time to start celebrating since the reference the comparison was made to -november 2008- was particularly bad , with a 60 % decrease from the previous year .
the outcome is that , regardless of last month 's upturn , the total number of registrations during those 11 months is 40 % below last year 's .
since january , 95,853 units of all the vehicle classes which make up the hotchpotch of light commercial vehicles were sold : derived vans , pick ups , vans , light vans and light-chassis trucks .
at the same time , the storm clouds affecting demand have not completely cleared , so even though they are also purchased by individuals , most purchases are made by small and medium-sized enterprises , almost all of which pay through external funding .
as a result of the restrictions caused by closed tap bank loans , it is necessary to add other factors like increasing unemployment and the persistent economic decline .
in light of this , unlike cars , the aid of the 2000epurchase has done little .
aside from individuals , provisions are made for the self-employed and smes that are going to purchase a light commercial vehicle of up to 3.5 tons with a co2 emission level not exceeding 160 grams per kilometer , but the number of transactions has been insignificant .
just yesterday , the need for the administration to devote special attention to these vehicles , and also to commercial verhicles -lrb- trucks and buses -rrb- , was brought to mind by ganvam .
the sellers ' association predicts that 2010 will be similar to the year coming to a close , which estimates a 19 % drop in sales -lrb- passenger cars and 4x4s -rrb- .
support for emergency braking is already obligatory
support systems to emergency brakes will have to be a mandatory feature in european cars , just as it happened with anti-lock breaks -lrb- abs -rrb- and will happen with stability control -lrb- esp -rrb-
in fact , they are already in all newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles , while the rest have a grace period until the end of february 2011 .
the measure , imposed by the european union , aims to increase pedestrian safety ; however , how they work can also help prevent many rear-end collisions .
what the emergency brake assistant does is increase the pressure on the brakes in the event of an emergency , which the system detects through the driver 's pressure on the pedal .
but this does n't always maintain that pressure through to the end .
according to a study conducted by the car components manufacturer , bosch , a third of drivers involved in an accident had not stepped on the brake before a collision and half of them did n't apply the full force .
up to 1,100 accidents
the intervention of the aid , however , calls for the full braking system , reducing the distance the car needs to stop .
according to an eu study , if all cars were equipped with this feature , 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be avoided a year .
the reduction will be even bigger -it estimates that one in four accidents injuring people would be avoided - when the so-called smart emergency braking systems become popular .
in this case , the vehicle is equipped with a system which -lrb- via radar or a camera -rrb- detects obstacles and warns the driver , in addition to lightly applying the brakes .
if the driver reacts , he helps it by increasing the pressure on the pedal if it is necessary .
if he does not react , and even though the collision is unavoidable , the device exerts the maximum force to the brakes to minimize damage .
general motors delays opel plan until january
while workers at the opel plant in figueruelas -lrb- zaragoza -rrb- have already been informed by nick reilly , the new president of general motors -lrb- gm -rrb- europe , that the production of the new meriva will begin in the first week of april -probably the 8th- as reported by javier ortega , the u.s. manufacturer is cautioning that more time is needed to conclude the recovery plan for opel .
nick reilly , the new president of gm europe , wants each of the points of the new plan to have the prior approval of the affected party .
and this may make the final document , which will be submitted first to the workers and then to the governments of the countries where there are factories , be delayed until the beginning of 2010 .
on the other hand , gm is making sure that a decision regarding the sale of saab should be made in the next few days .
it is not strange that the swedish government has increased the pressure on the u.s. manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible .
gm admits to having had contact with some potential new buyers .
one of them could be geely , which aims to acquire volvo , but the option of the dutch sports car manufacturer skyper , which is funded by the russian group converg , is gaining momentum .
in the event that none of them come to an agreement , gm would be able to sell some saab assets to the chinese baic .
the decision to close saab at the end of the year if it is not sold still stands .
driving the porsche boxster spyder
to develop their latest and most precious gem , the porsche engineers took the boxster s as a base and succeeded in trimming it by no less than 80 kilos , making the total weight a mere 1,275 kilos .
this led them to , first , cutting out the automatic roof , which has been substituted by a manually-operated canvas one , saving 21 kilos ; using aluminum doors , like those on the gt3 , ' dropping ' another 15 , removing the climate control , 13 ; reducing the gas tank from 64 to 54 liters , earning 7 more kilos ; mounting sporty bucket seats , another 12 , and with the 19-inch lightweight wheels , five .
finally , foregoing the cdr-30 sound system brought it down another 6 kilograms , and changing the door handles to fabric ones cut the remaining kilo .
even though it is also available with the pdk dual-clutch shift , the test was conducted on a unit with the six-speed manual transmission , mainly on the back roads of california and along stretches of really windy mountain roads .
its performance can only be described as flawless .
the reduction in weight does not imply that the car does n't grip the asphalt .
rather the complete opposite : it has been some time since we tested a model so small and light , which , in turn , transmitted so much confidence when cornering , even at high speeds .
it is a small athlete , able to warm up its muscles in a low gear for as long as we need , until ordered to sprint , to brake , to recover and go back to exploiting its engine ...
just what we asked for . thanks to its steering , as communicative as it is precise , what we tell it with our hands on the wheel is what the car will do .
and it will do it with surgical precision .
optional engine noise
the sound of its v6 boxer with 320 horse power -lrb- 10 more than the boxster s -rrb- is well made and can be enhancedwith the ' sport ' option and through a system that modifies the roar of the engine , which debuted earlier in the panamera .
the acceleration is brutal , either from a standstill or recovering .
the suspension is firm but not harsh or uncomfortable .
the asphalt of the highways we crossed with the boxster spyder was fairly beaten up , but the car handled the potholes well .
the electronic aids hardly showed up on the course ; that is because , well into the morning , we found early morning ice and gravel on some curves .
in short , it is an ultra lightweight car , one of the most fun to drive on the market , andis a bit more than just a simple modification of the boxster s.
the car will go on sale in february 2010 , priced at 70,931 euros .
' bag girl '
close to karl lagerfeld , the image of the coco cocoon line and occasional ' starlet ' of the catwalk , the singer lavishes her bad-girl image with as much contempt as she has chanel bags .
more than a ' bad girl ' or ' it girl ' , she is a 'bag girl ' .
baskonia gives away a victory in israel
caja laboral achieved a stunning 82-91 victory on their visit to the maccabee electra court despite dusko ivanovic 's team 's heavy losses , and after the great performance by mizra teltovic , who was the best on his team with eight three-pointers scored -lrb- 29 points -rrb- , they now at the top of their group .
the vitorian team knew to make up for the significant absences of herrmann , oleson , huertas and micov with a big dose of involvement and team work , even though it had to hold out until the end to take the victory .
additionally , their huge success from the sidelines , with 16 three pointers scored , had a lot to do with the final triumph .
the game started out in favor of the azulgranas , who put themselves ahead on the scoreboard from the start .
as vitora 's first four baskets were from the perimeter , the speculation was already that they had jumped into the israeli net with hot wrists .
english and teletovic were the main scorers of the 18-20 at the end of the first period .
the second quarter was more of the same , but the alavan team opted for the inside game of barac and the work of eliyahu , who was greeted with whistles and applause at his return home , to continue increasing their lead by half-time -lrb- 34-43 -rrb- .
teletovic had already begun to stand out as the best on his team with 13 points , even though splitter 's " six fewer " points already signaled that it was n't going to be the best night for the brazilian .
but the game , despite being headed for half time , was not more decidedand the maccabees tried to remind the vitorians that not just anybody wins on their court , and with the ' hand of elias ' putting the pressure on , they managed to get involved in the game .
eidson and pnini played a decisive role in the " yellows " ' return to the light .
